# FusionAuth Export/Import Commands

These python files are simple scripts that do 2 things:

1. Export the current configuration of your FusionAuth server using the API into a json file.

2. Apply the configuration of that saved json file to a running FusionAuth instance.

I build these scripts as I need a simple/repeatable way to export the configuration from my development server into production.

These scripts are extremely rough and were written for my own use. Use at your own risk.
